### COMP 4331 Knowledge Discovery and Data
### Mining, Fall 2018
#### Frequent Itemset Mining via Programming
##### There is a transacton database stored in the link: https://github.com/comp4331fall18/sample-code-DM/blob/master/freq_items_datasets.txt.
#### Mine Frequent Itemsets
##### • Frequent itemset mining using Apriori of the transactions (Compile Apriori method in the A1 itsc stuid code Apr.py)
##### • Frequent itemset mining based on FP-Growth (Compile FP-growth methodin the A1 itsc stuid code fp.py)
##### • Frequent itemset mining via Recursive Elemination (Compile Relim methodin the A1 itsc stuid code relim.py).
# 
### Closed Frequent Itemsets
##### Based on the frequent itemsets you mined previously, write a Python 2 or Python 3 program to mine the closed frequent itemsets and maximal frequent itemsets.
#### Data Description
###### The benchmark dataset freq items dataset is supported by the IBM Almaden Quest research group, which contains 1,000 items and 100,000 transactions. For simplicity, each number uniquely identifies an item.
